<strong>Description</strong><br>
Movieskip helps people find movies they want to watch by excluding everything that they've already decided<br>
is not of their interest. We've all been their with some friends trying to find a movie to watch watch. There<br>
is always someone who has seen the suggestion or really doesn't want to. Movieskip gets through the bigger part<br>
of these issues, besides, everytime to try to find a movie, you make it easier for the upcoming selections.
