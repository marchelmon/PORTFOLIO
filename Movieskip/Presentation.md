<strong>Description</strong><br>
Movieskip helps people find movies they want to watch by excluding everything they have already decided<br>
is not of their interest. We've all been there trying to find a movie to watch with some friends. There<br>
is always someone who has seen the suggestion or really doesn't want to. Movieskip gets through the bigger<br>
part of these issues.Besides, everytime you try to find a movie, you make it easier for the upcoming<br>
selections.
